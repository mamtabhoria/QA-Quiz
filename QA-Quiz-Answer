To test the portal login. I would have tested all the basic functionalities to make sure the quality of the portal login is kept. I would have also had done happy path test to make sure, the process of portal login is working as per the requirements.

I would have also tested all the features in deep to make sure the portal is bug free and quality of it is kept. 
 For testing purposes, I'd have created test cases for username and password to make sure the quality of the software is kept by creating test cases: 

- correct e-mail address and password. 
- Incorrect e-mail address and password
- Correct e-mail address and no password
- Incorrect email address and correct password style
- No e-mail address and no password
- No e-mail and password. 

I would have used API and Cypress for testing purposes because, Cypress is javascript test automation solution designed to test web-browsers. It helps both developers and QA to do End-to-End testing, Integration Testing, and Unit Testing. Cypress also provides suggestions on how to fix a problem if a test case fails. For API testing, I would have used Postman. It is used to test end point interaction methods, which includes:

- GET (obtain information)
- POST (Add information)
- PUT (Replace information)
- Patch (Update a certain information)
- DELETE (Delete a information)

To test in API, I would have used POST command while creating a new account. 
To gather information on existing user for signing purposes, I would have used GET command and use an existing dummy customer for testing purposes. Based on the response code we would know, if the test case was a pass or what went wrong:
100 Series: Temporal response
200 Series: Accepts the requests
300 Series: Responses related to URL indirection
400 Series: Client response error
500 Series: Server response error.
